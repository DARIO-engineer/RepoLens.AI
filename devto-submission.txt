This is a submission for the [GitHub Copilot CLI Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/github-2026-01-21)

## What I Built

**RepoLens AI** is an AI-powered web application that instantly analyzes any public GitHub repository and delivers a comprehensive technical report — complete with stunning, zero-dependency SVG visualizations you won't find anywhere else.

Paste a GitHub URL, and in seconds you get:
- 🏗️ Architectural Summary
- 🛠️ Full Stack Breakdown
- 💪 Strengths & ⚠️ Weaknesses
- 💡 Improvement Suggestions
- 🌱 Beginner-Friendly Tasks

But what truly sets RepoLens AI apart are its **5 unique visualizations**, all built in pure SVG with zero chart libraries:

| Visualization | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🌈 **Language Ring** | Animated donut chart with official GitHub language colors |
| 📡 **Health Radar** | Pentagon radar chart scoring 5 health dimensions |
| 🗺️ **Architecture Graph** | Interactive node graph of the project's folder structure with collapse/expand breathe animation |
| 🧬 **Repo Personality** | Myers-Briggs style analysis — assigns an archetype (Pioneer, Guardian, Architect, Sprinter, Scholar, Community) with traits, radar chart, and dimension breakdown |
| 🌐 **Hero Orb** | Atmospheric animated background orb for visual depth |

The app also features:
- 🌍 **Full i18n** — English (default) + Portuguese, with AI responses respecting the selected language
- 📱 **Responsive design** — Desktop 2-column grid for Strengths/Weaknesses, mobile-first everywhere
- 📋 **Copy & Export** — Copy analysis to clipboard or download as `.md`
- 🕐 **Analysis timer** — Shows how long the AI took
- 📜 **History** — Recently analyzed repos saved locally
- 🔄 **Smart fallback** — Graceful degradation when AI quota is exceeded

**Tech Stack:** React 19 + Vite 7.3 + TailwindCSS v4 | Express 5 + ES Modules | Google Gemini AI with automatic model discovery and fallback chain | GitHub REST API

## My Experience with GitHub Copilot CLI

GitHub Copilot CLI wasn't just a helper in this project — it was my **pair programming partner from start to finish**. Every major feature, every tricky bug, every architectural decision went through `gh copilot` in the terminal.

### How I Used It

**1. Architecture & Refactoring**
```bash
$ gh copilot suggest "refactor express server into modular architecture with services and routes"
```
Copilot suggested creating `services/github.js`, `services/gemini.js`, and `routes/analyze.js` with clean separation of concerns. What would have taken me 30+ minutes of planning happened in seconds.

**2. Critical Bug Resolution**
```bash
$ gh copilot explain "why is API_KEY undefined when using ES modules with dotenv"
```
This was a showstopper. ES module imports are hoisted, so `dotenv.config()` runs *after* the imports that need the env vars. Copilot immediately identified the issue and suggested `import "dotenv/config"` as the first import. Bug fixed in under 10 seconds.

**3. Zero-Dependency Visualizations**
```bash
$ gh copilot suggest "create an SVG pentagon radar chart in React without any chart library"
```
The Health Radar visualization was born from this single command. Copilot generated polar coordinate calculations, `requestAnimationFrame` animation, and interactive hover — all in pure SVG. I then refined it, but the foundation was solid from the start.

**4. AI Output Normalization**
```bash
$ gh copilot suggest "build a normalizeAnalysis function that transforms any AI output format into canonical sections"
```
Gemini's output format is unpredictable. Copilot generated a fuzzy-matching system with accent stripping, universal header regex, and variation mapping that makes the analysis 100% consistent regardless of how Gemini formats its response.

**5. Performance Optimization**
```bash
$ gh copilot suggest "smart file tree filtering for GitHub repos to reduce prompt size"
```
Created an intelligent filter system with `CODE_EXTENSIONS`, `IMPORTANT_FILES`, and `IGNORED_PATTERNS` to keep the file tree compact. This reduced prompt size by ~60%, making analysis faster and cheaper.

**6. Frontend Polish**
```bash
$ gh copilot suggest "animated SVG donut chart for language breakdown with GitHub official colors"
```
The Language Ring visualization came from this — cubic ease-out animation, hover glow effects, 35+ official GitHub language colors with HSL fallback.

### Impact by the Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| CLI commands used | 40+ |
| Bugs resolved | 12 |
| Features generated | 8 |
| Estimated time saved | ~6 hours |

### What I Learned

Copilot CLI fundamentally changed how I approach development:

- **Think in prompts, not code** — Instead of writing boilerplate, I describe what I want and refine the output
- **Debug faster** — `gh copilot explain` is incredibly powerful for understanding *why* something fails, not just *what* failed
- **Architectural confidence** — Using `gh copilot suggest` for structure decisions gives you well-reasoned patterns immediately
- **Zero-dependency mindset** — Copilot helped me build complex SVG visualizations that would normally require Chart.js or D3 — keeping the bundle lean (96KB gzipped JS)

The CLI workflow is addictive. No context switching to a browser, no copy-pasting from StackOverflow. Just terminal → prompt → solution → build. This is how I want to develop from now on.
